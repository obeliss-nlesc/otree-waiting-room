## Developing

Please run `prettier --write .` before you make a commit, or let your IDE handle it.

## Unit tests

The unit tests can be found in the `test` directory. They use Node.js built-in [testing API](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/test.html) and [assertion API](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/assert.html), which requires Node 20. To run the rests, run the following at the root of the project:

```shell
npm run test
```
